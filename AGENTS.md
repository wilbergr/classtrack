# Expo HAS CHANGED

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing any code.
The installed `.d.ts` files under `node_modules/` are the ground truth for API shapes
(e.g. `expo-notifications/build/Notifications.types.d.ts`, `expo-sqlite/build/*.d.ts`).

Key SDK 57 facts already verified against the installed types:
- expo-sqlite: async API — `openDatabaseAsync`, `execAsync`, `runAsync`, `getFirstAsync`,
  `getAllAsync`. Migrations use `PRAGMA user_version`.
- expo-notifications: foreground handler returns `shouldShowBanner`/`shouldShowList`
  (not `shouldShowAlert`); scheduled triggers need an explicit
  `type: SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.DATE` and take an optional `channelId`.

# Architecture (Layer 1)

Local-first, zero backend: SQLite on-device, local notifications only, no network calls.

- `src/types.ts` — domain types; `src/theme.ts` — all colors/spacing (never hardcode colors)
- `src/db/database.ts` — singleton `getDb()`, schema/migrations, CRUD
- `src/notifications.ts` — permission + Android channel + reminder scheduling
- `src/screens/`, `src/components/`, `src/navigation.ts` (typed param lists), `App.tsx` (tabs + stack)

Invariant: each assignment row persists its scheduled notification ids (`notification_ids`
JSON column). Any mutation must go through `refreshAssignmentRemindersAsync()` (cancels stale
ids, reschedules, persists new ids); deletes return the ids so callers can cancel them.

Keyboard handling on form screens (see `AssignmentEditScreen`): `KeyboardAvoidingView` with
`behavior` `padding` on iOS (plus `keyboardVerticalOffset={useHeaderHeight()}` — screens sit
under a native-stack header) and `undefined` on Android, where the window already resizes
(`softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` defaults to `resize`; padding there would double-compensate).
Neither platform auto-scrolls a bottom-of-form input into the shrunken viewport — scroll it
into view explicitly on focus/`keyboardDidShow`.

# Spark (gamification) — Layer 1.5

One economy, one face: captures/completions earn **Sparks** (schema v2:
`progress`, `ledger`, `settings`, `unlocks` tables + `assignments.completed_at`).

- `src/gamification/engine.ts` is the ONLY writer of `progress`/`ledger`. The
  ledger is append-only and idempotent (partial unique index on
  `(kind, assignment_id)`), so complete → un-complete → complete never
  re-awards; `progress` is a rebuildable rollup cache. Momentum settles lazily
  (`settleMomentumAsync` on app open + before awards, idempotent per day via
  `progress.last_settled_day`).
- Engine emits typed events (`src/gamification/events.ts`); UI (SparkBurst
  overlay, SparkPill, companion) subscribes. Screens only call engine award
  functions — feedback (sound/haptic/toast) is centralized in `SparkBurst`.
- `src/settings.ts`: typed JSON settings over the `settings` table with an
  in-memory cache (`loadSettingsAsync()` at app start; `useSettings()` hook).
  Playful defaults (Hype vibe, Pop theme, Wisp companion, sound on) — calm is
  the opt-down, chosen in onboarding or Settings.
- **Theming:** `src/theme/` — `useTheme()` + per-component
  `makeStyles(colors)` via `useMemo`. There is deliberately NO static colors
  export; never hardcode a color, always add tokens to every palette in
  `src/theme/palettes.ts` (incl. urgency ramp + companion tints).
- **Companion drives the theme** (`themeSource` setting, default
  `'companion'`): each companion has a signature palette via
  `COMPANION_THEME` in `palettes.ts` (wisp→ember, pip→meadow, juno→dusk,
  unit7→circuit, nova→rocket, rex→lagoon, otto→nocturne, none→slate).
  Manual picks (Settings chips, Spark-shop
  equip) set `themeSource: 'manual'` + `themeId`; "Match sidekick" in
  Settings returns to companion-driven. `loadSettingsAsync` migrates
  pre-themeSource users: non-default stored themeId ⇒ pinned manual.
  Signature palettes are not in `THEME_META` (not shop items — they come
  with the companion).
- Motion: `useCalmMotion()` (OS reduced-motion OR Reduce-effects OR Chill
  vibe) must gate every spring/particle. Urgency/status is never conveyed by
  color, motion, or sound alone.
- Sounds in `assets/sounds/*.wav` are locally SYNTHESIZED placeholders (tiny
  PCM chimes, no license issues). Swappable later for Kenney.nl CC0 UI audio —
  same filenames, no code change.
- Notification copy lives in `src/gamification/copy.ts` (voice packs
  ember/sage/dot/plain). Hash-pick + settings-persisted recent-ring; copy
  re-rolls on every edit because reminders cancel+reschedule. Daily digest =
  rolling 7 days at 4 PM on its own `daily-digest` channel, ids persisted in
  settings, refreshed on app open.
- **Copy rulebook (hard constraints, enforce in every change):** never any
  diagnosis/clinical wording (it's a fun planner for every student); no shame
  ("failed/broke/lost/still haven't"); nothing is ever taken away (levels
  never drop, Sparks never revoked, companion never sickens — worst case
  asleep); no timed/expiring rewards; overdue = "whenever you're ready",
  digest-only, never pushed; all state on-device, no network calls.
- Voice capture (`expo-speech-recognition`) is default-OFF with a disclosure
  in Settings: the OS speech engine may route audio through Google/Apple —
  keep it opt-in.
- New native modules since Layer 1: `react-native-reanimated`,
  `expo-haptics`, `react-native-svg`, `expo-audio`, `expo-splash-screen`,
  `expo-speech-recognition`, `@shopify/react-native-skia` → owner must run a
  FRESH `eas build` dev client (a JS reload of the old dev client will crash
  on missing native modules).

# Companion Home (Layer 2)

The companion is the app's face: `Home` is the first tab and the initial
route (`launchScreen` setting opts down to Today-first).

- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` — bubble queue + big companion + glance day
  card + quick add/Progress actions. Companion `none` renders the `EnergyOrb`
  home with Plain-pack info-card bubbles; same layout, no dead end. There is
  deliberately NO name/stage label under the companion — the `identity`
  bubble slot carries name + stage progress instead; renaming lives in
  Settings → Sidekick.
- `src/gamification/guidance.ts` — speech bubbles are deterministic
  templates over on-device day data (NO network/LLM, ever). Slots live in
  `BUBBLES` in `copy.ts` (all four packs; apply the copy rulebook to every
  new line). Selection reuses `pickTemplate` with a bubbles-own recent-ring
  (`recentBubbleTemplates`); the ring records lines when actually shown.
- **The rig is model + renderer:** `src/components/companion/model.ts` is a
  pure parametric model (species/stage/mood/theme → layers of primitive
  shapes); `SkiaRig.tsx` draws it (one Canvas; per-layer `Group` transforms
  driven by Reanimated shared values; real `BlurMask` glow on aura/shimmer).
  Never animate react-native-svg props per-frame (New-Arch potholes) — SVG
  remains only for static art (EnergyMeter/Orb, Progress ring, bubble tail,
  tab icons).
- **Rig v3 anatomy (chibi full body):** 100×100 space, oversized head
  (~y 6–57), torso tucked under it (overlap the seam — no gaps), stubby
  limbs (`arms` layer, thick round strokes / rects, sways with breath phase
  lag), feet/tail on the ground line ~y 88, shadow y 94, neckline ≈ y 57
  (accessory anchor; halo/crown ≈ y 5). Eyes are white sclera (face layer) +
  a wandering pupil group: tinted iris ring, species-dark pupil, dual
  catchlights, converged ~0.5 inward. Layers may set `pivot` so sway reads
  as a hinge (arms at the shoulder, sprouts at the base); `RigModel.float`
  hover-bobs every layer but the shadow (Wisp), which narrows as the body
  rises; the renderer's `breathWave` is an asymmetric sine (quick inhale,
  slow exhale). All rig colors derive from `colors.companion[species]` via
  lighten/darken — the only literal is white. Seven species share `cuteFace`
  except unit7 (screen face); otto passes `beak`/`eyeScale`. To eyeball
  changes without a device: the model is pure TS — compile it standalone and
  serialize shapes to SVG (the shape union maps 1:1 onto SVG elements), as
  `scripts/generate-branding.js` does.
- Evolution: 5 stages from `stageForLevel` (levels 1/3/5/9/14), driven by
  `progress.lifetime` so forms can never be bought or lost; stages only ever
  map upward. The evolution moment is detected via the `lastSeenStage`
  settings key on Home load (works no matter where the award happened) and
  is replayable from Progress. Poking is affection only — no economy hooks.
- Theme rule extension: `dayPhase` tokens (morning/evening ambient tints)
  exist in EVERY palette; add them to any new palette.
- Tab bar: custom SVG glyphs in `src/components/TabBarIcon.tsx` (filled
  active / outline idle, highlight pill + bold label carry selection — never
  color alone). The navigator renders BOTH focused and unfocused variants
  and cross-fades them. `tabBarStyle.height` overrides the default, so it
  must include `useSafeAreaInsets().bottom` itself.

# Branding assets

All of `assets/*.png` (icon, adaptive-icon layers, monochrome, notification,
splash, favicon) are generated from the companion rig itself — Wisp stage 4 in
the Ember palette — by `npm run branding` (`scripts/generate-branding.js`:
transpiles the pure model/palettes standalone, serializes shapes to SVG,
rasterizes with `@resvg/resvg-js`, deterministic + offline). Never hand-edit
the PNGs; re-run the script after rig or Ember-palette changes. The `app.json`
colors (adaptive-icon background `#251507`, splash `#FFF6EC`, notification tint
`#D9480F`) are Ember tokens — keep them in sync with `src/theme/palettes.ts`.

# EAS builds (config only — owner runs the builds)

- `eas.json`: `development` (dev client, internal, APK), `preview` (internal APK), `production`
  (store defaults, AAB). `appVersionSource: "local"` → bump `android.versionCode` in `app.json`
  manually. Android package: `com.wilbergr.classtrack`.
- `extra.eas.projectId` in `app.json` is the owner's EAS project id (public identifier, not a
  secret) — written by the owner's first `eas build` and now committed. Don't regenerate it,
  and never run `eas login`/`eas init`/`eas build` from an agent session. Runbook: see
  "Android dev build" in `HANDOFF.md`.
- Dev server on WSL2: never `sudo npx expo start`; use `--tunnel` or mirrored networking —
  see "Troubleshooting: running the dev server on WSL2" in `HANDOFF.md`.

# Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass clean (strict mode).
- `npx expo export --platform android --output-dir <tmp>` is a good no-device smoke test
  (full Metro + Hermes bundle catches broken imports).

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
